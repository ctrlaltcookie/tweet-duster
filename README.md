# tweet-duster

So basically twitter is garbage and you shouldn't need to feel afraid that 10 years ago when you were drunk at school/uni and wrote
some vapid bigoted garbage and now your current employer is gonna fire you. Tweets are stupid, pointless and twitter should not have
a permanent history, the only reason it does is because other blogging platforms did at the time of it's inception. That's literally it.

## How to dust / get started

Okay so you need to do a bunch of things: 

* you need to installed `nodejs` and `npm`
* you need to run `npm ci`
* you need to get hold of your consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token_key and access_token_secret 
[more info here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens)
* then you'll need to make a file and fill it full of the id's of the tweets you wanna delete, you can find these tweets [by downloading
your twitter archive](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive)
* once you've done all this, run the duster and it'll murder your tweets for you, toit roight?

## Improvements

This could do with a LOT of improvements which is why i'm going to setup a service that will let you delete all tweets before this 
year for a small (negotiable) fee.
